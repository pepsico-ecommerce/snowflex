## [1.0] - 2025-04-24

This release is a ground up rewrite of the library.

We completely remove ODBC in favor of utilizing Snowflex's HTTP API, and remove support for password based authentication, in line with Snowflake's own approach.

We also now expose a fully Ecto/DBConnection compatible implementation.

For complete details, as well as some helpful migration instructions, see the README.
